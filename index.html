        <!-- Column 1: Abstract, Introduction & Significance -->
        <div class="column">
            <h3 class="section-title">Abstract</h3>
            <p>This project explores classifying various species of leaves using machine learning techniques. 
            Three classifiers (KNN, Random Forest, and SVC) were evaluated, and the validation accuracies 
            for each model were compared to determine the most effective approach for leaf classification.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-title">Introduction & Significance</h3>
            <p>Accurate classification of leaves is essential in botanical studies, plant taxonomy, and environmental monitoring. 
            Machine learning techniques provide a scalable and efficient way to categorize plant species based on leaf characteristics, 
            which can significantly contribute to biodiversity conservation efforts and ecological studies.</p>

        <!-- Column 2: Methods -->
        <div class="column">
            <h3 class="section-title">Methods</h3>
            <p><strong>Preprocessing:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>No null values were present in the dataset.</li>
                <li>The classes were balanced, with all species represented equally.</li>
                <li>Dropped the 'id' and 'species' columns from the feature set.</li>
                <li>Standardized features using StandardScaler to ensure fair comparison across models.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <p><strong>Classifiers:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>KNN: A distance-based classifier.</li>
                <li>RandomForest: A tree-based ensemble method.</li>
                <li>SVC: A linear support vector classifier.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <!-- Insert random images here, displayed in a row -->
            <!-- Example code would be here -->

        <!-- Column 3: Results -->
        <div class="column">
            <h3 class="section-title">Results: Kaggle Submissions</h3>
            <p>We evaluated three models on the Kaggle platform, and KNN achieved the best performance:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>KNN</strong>: 0.14407 log loss</li>
                <li><strong>SVC</strong>: 2.088 log loss</li>
                <li><strong>RandomForest</strong>: 0.687 log loss</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As KNN achieved the best performance, we used it for the final model.</p>

        <!-- Column 4: Discussion and Conclusion -->
        <div class="column">
            <h3 class="section-title">Discussion</h3>
            <p>KNN performed exceptionally well due to its ability to capture distances between points effectively in this leaf classification problem. 
            Since leaf data often involves subtle differences between species, a distance-based method like KNN was able to distinguish between them more accurately than linear models or tree-based ensembles. 
            The results from Kaggle further reinforce this conclusion, with KNN outperforming SVC and RandomForest in terms of log loss.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models in leaf classification tasks. 
            The KNN model provided the best performance, indicating its suitability for this dataset. 
            Future studies could explore more complex models or additional feature engineering to improve classification results further.</p>
